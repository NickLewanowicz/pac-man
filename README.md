# PacMan.  In your Browser.

### [See it in action](https://www.emberscreencasts.com/pacman)

### Put it in your app

1. `ember install pac-man`
2. Include the `{{pac-man}}` component anywhere in your app

### Make it your own

3. [Read how it was made](https://leanpub.com/buildpacman).
4. Create your own levels, change variables... maybe help me write a better AI?

### Once again, how can I read about how to BUILD PACMAN?

By buying my book, [BUILD PACMAN](https://leanpub.com/buildpacman)
